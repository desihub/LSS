#all "potential assignments" are kept, meaning each targetid will appear many times
#then, it collects the new spec data for any archived/zdone tiles (incl. the info in the zmtl files used to decide mtl updates)
#then, it combines data from the healpix files selecting on given target types + notqso combinations; notqso means that targets passing the qso selection are removed
#for this combination, only data at the tileids/fiberids that were considered good are kept

#in this step, only unique targetid are kept, prioritizing those with an observation and then those with the greatest tsnr2
#targets at tileids/fiberid where none of the given type were assigned are masked
#if enhanced information on qso or ELG targets exists, it is added
#completeness statistics per tile grouping ('COMP_TILE') and per tileid/fiberid ('FRACZTILELOCID') are calculated
