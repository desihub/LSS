#steps for producing randoms matched to angular geometry

run fiberassign on tiles from each run #need to copy random random file for GRAY either copy or make new for BRIGHT

Take outputs, remove those with fiber status != 1 from fibermap; need to connect tile and exposure info from exposures files

Cut to unique IDs

Concatenate files; vstack is easiest code wise but sometimes inefficient

Match back to parent file to get full info #what is most efficient way to do this?; I think we have a narrow strip in Dec, so cut main random file that way first, then combine
