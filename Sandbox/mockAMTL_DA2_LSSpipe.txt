#prepare dark mock input catalogs (run on interactive queue with one cpus per realization. Do not apply photometric mask). 
#It is sbatch script calling to run1_prepmock_LSS_DA2.sh as array parallelization, calling finally to: prepare_mocks_Y3_dark.py or prepare_mocks_Y3_bright.py

#Apply imaging mask to dark (change manually the range of realizations to run on ARRAY mode in slurm). Run on shared queue with 128 cpus

>> sbatch $LSSCODE/scripts/mock_tools/abamtl_applyphotmask_sbatch_da2.sh DARK

#Apply imaging mask to bright (change manually the range of realizations to run on ARRAY mode in slurm). Run on shared queue with 128 cpus

--- Up to here, all products needed to create complete or FFA samples are created ---


# NEXT: Steps toward the most realistic mock [ALTMTL] (It will take a few days to complete the following steps)

#Initialize AltMTL for dark [Run on shared queue with 32 cpus]. Run on ARRAY mode

>> sbatch $LSSCODE/scripts/mock_tools/script_initialize_da2_dark.sh

#Initialize AltMTL for bright [Run on shared queue with 32 cpus]. Run on ARRAY mode

>> sbatch $LSSCODE/scripts/mock_tools/script_initialize_da2_bright.sh

#Run ALTMTL for dark. This will initiate the whole fba cicle in parallel in mock realizations. Some variables need to be changed: path2LSS, [mockinit, mockend, mocklist]

>> nohup $LSSCODE/bin/DA2ALTMTLRealizationsDARK_mock.sh &

You probably need to run it at least twice to complete all the fba tasks. Be carefull, the DA2ALTMTLRealizationsDARK_mock.sh will be copied to the target directory (ALTMTLHOME) under altmtl{mock_number}. Ideally you should execute it from there the second time.

#Run AltMTL for bright. This will initiate the whole fba cicle in parallel in mock realizations. Some variables need to be changed: path2LSS, [mockinit, mockend, mocklist]

>> nohup $LSSCODE/bin/DA2ALTMTLRealizationsBRIGHT_mock.sh &

You probably need to run it at least twice to complete all the fba tasks. Be carefull, the DA2ALTMTLRealizationsDARK_mock.sh will be copied to the target directory (ALTMTLHOME) under altmtl{mock_number}. Ideally you should execute it from there the second time.
