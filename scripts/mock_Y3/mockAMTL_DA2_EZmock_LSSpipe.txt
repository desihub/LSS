# It is based on the process of LSS/Sandbox/mockAMTL_DA2_LSSpipe.txt, and shows steps for DA2 LSS AltMTL EZmocks. 

1. sbatch prepare_altmtl_EZmocks.sl
   >> run prepare_EZmocks_Y3.py which is modified from LSS/scripts/mock_tools/prepare_mocks_Y3_dark.py
   >> run concatenate_EZmock_targets.py

2. sbatch initialize_da2_altmtl_EZmock_dark.sl
  
3. sbatch run_fba_regular.sl
   >> this step is same as "nohup $LSSCODE/bin/DA2ALTMTLRealizationsDARK_mock.sh &" but using job script. You 
      can submit many jobs with varying mockinit, mockend at the same time.
      Our test shows that it is doable to run 50 mocks in a cpu node. The running time is ~41 hours.
      In the job script, we set run time 48 hours. If the queue time is long, you cna set e.g. 12 hours, and submit jobs
      ~4 times until it is done.

(4). If one mock failed in step 3, we can redo setp 2 and 3 for that failed single mock.
     For step 3, we can use shared mode, sbatch run_fba_shared.sl
