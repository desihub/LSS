#ideas on random processing for alt MTL mocks

#PRIORITY values are needed for sort, so cannot skip to data dark/bright full_noveto
#But, can copy current data processing and make dark/bright full_noveto
#function cattools.mkfullran_prog
# call it something like
	outf = dirout+pdir+'_'+str(ii)+'_full_noveto.ran.fits'
	logger.info('about to make full ran '+outf)
	ct.mkfullran_prog(gtl,ldirspec,ii,imbits,outf,pdir)

#TSNR2 masking now happens in good hardware definition, so in mock_tools.createrancomb_wdupspec , dataspec table should not be needed anymore

#then, in masking section, need to tell it to read pdir instead of args.tracer + notqso, e.g., current line 527 would become

fin = os.path.join(dirout, pdir + '_' + str(rann) + '_full_noveto.ran.fits')
